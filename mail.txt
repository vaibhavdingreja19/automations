Dear [Client’s Name],

I hope you’re doing well.

As discussed earlier, our team has been investigating the intermittent failures of the auto-merge functionality via TeamCity using the GitHub App integration. We raised this issue with the TeamCity vendor, and they have analyzed the logs we provided.

Based on their response, the failures may be linked to issues with GitHub App installation tokens. These tokens can sometimes fail to refresh or be issued—particularly when:
	•	The GitHub App settings are modified on GitHub’s end.
	•	Tokens are reused across multiple VCS roots or with differing fetch URLs.
	•	The repository is restricted in a way that prevents token access.

The vendor has suggested capturing additional debug-level logs for the affected VCS roots to identify the exact cause. However, we currently have the plugin-buildEvents-logConfig.xml set to debug level for other ongoing reports. We are therefore evaluating how we can enable multiple specific debug log presets without impacting our existing configurations.

In parallel, they mentioned a workaround using the “acquire new” action in the VCS root settings to generate a fresh token. While this is not recommended for regular use (as it creates new database entries), we are considering this as a reconfiguration step if needed.

We will continue monitoring and share any concrete findings or resolutions as we proceed with debugging.

Please let us know if you have any questions or require further details.

Kind regards,
Vaibhav Dingreja
