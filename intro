Hi, I’m [Your Name].
I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science from Graphic Era University in 2020. I began my professional journey with Cognizant, and since July 2024, I’ve been working with the John Hancock and Manulife account.

I hold multiple AWS certifications, including the AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate and AWS Certified Developer – Associate. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with Python scripting and hold the PCEP certification.

In my current role, I focus on platform support and automation. I work extensively with tools like TeamCity and GitHub, driving efficiencies and process improvements. Recently, I developed an end-to-end GitHub disaster recovery automation, where we take backups of our entire JHDevOps GitHub organization. The solution involves cloning repositories, compressing them to optimize storage, and uploading them to Azure Storage, leveraging Python’s concurrency features to speed up the process.

Beyond that, I’ve worked on several other automation projects, including line-of-code analysis and GitHub archival automations. I’m passionate about solving problems and finding ways to optimize workflows using cloud and scripting solutions.

I’m excited to bring my experience and continue adding value to the team.
