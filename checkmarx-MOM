The discussion focused on the current status and next steps related to Checkmarx licensing, setup, and migration. Dan and the team reviewed the ongoing coordination between Checkmarx, JHancock, and Manulife regarding the procurement of the new SaaS license. The previous Checkmarx license has expired, and the team is waiting for CRG to finalize the SaaS license and provide the necessary updates.

Until the new license is issued, setup and project configurations are on hold. Once the license is renewed, the team will proceed with project setup, scans, and migration activities in collaboration with Checkmarx, who will assist in transitioning from the on-premise setup to the cloud (Checkmarx One). The current target completion date is December 31, 2025, after which a new CAP will be required.

The team noted that the cloud license expired in August, and no new work can begin until a purchase order under the MSA is approved. Checkmarx has committed to helping migrate suppression files during the transition. All ongoing on-prem projects will be moved to CxOne once the licensing issue is resolved.

Due to the current code freeze, scans cannot be run in CxOne as the old on-prem instance is blocked. Once the purchase order is approved, both on-prem and cloud environments will be available again. Until then, Checkmarx and Manulife are coordinating to obtain an exemption allowing temporary use.

Additionally, the team will attempt to configure scans for the TeamCity production environment. Although the license limitation may prevent successful execution, the setup process will be initiated. Dan has a follow-up meeting scheduled at 12:30 PM today with Checkmarx representatives to receive further updates and will share the outcomes afterward.

Hi Dan and team,

Here are the updates and findings on the action items discussed, along with proposed timelines.

Status updates (re: option #1 – immediate approach):
	•	CX1 project names have been updated to match the corresponding GitHub repository names.
	•	VCS triggers have been enabled for the existing projects.
	•	The additional JH ANN repository has been set up in CX1.
	•	TeamCity job configuration and triggers are now aligned with the CX1 setup.

Investigation: Passing branch & TeamCity build number to CX1
	•	Branch name is supported and is already being passed via the new Checkmarx One AST runner.
	•	TeamCity build number cannot be passed directly using the new CX1 AST runner (unlike legacy CxSAST).
	•	The AST runner does not expose a comments or metadata field for persisting CI build numbers.
	•	We are currently exploring a workaround by adding an additional TeamCity build step (command-line) after the AST scan to pass build metadata (build number, branch) to CX1 using supported APIs.

GitHub App integration
	•	We do not see the GitHub App integration option available in our CX1 tenant UI.
	•	Documentation exists, but the feature appears to be tenant / license / feature-flag dependent.
	•	Recommendation: Dan to reach out to Checkmarx One Support to confirm:
	•	Whether the GitHub App integration feature flag is enabled for our tenant
	•	Whether our current CX1 license includes GitHub App integration
	•	Expected availability timeline if not currently enabled

Target date
	•	Proposed target to complete the remaining investigation and align on next steps: 27th Jan 2026

Please let us know if you’d like us to proceed with implementing the additional TeamCity build step for passing metadata, or if you’d prefer to wait for guidance from Checkmarx Support regarding GitHub App integration.

Thanks,
Vaibhav
